# Ecuador
A place for us to organgize our code

This is a repository where we will put the code we create for our work in and related to Ecuador research.

## Study Designs

### Experiment #1
4 Permanent Stations

| Sensor        | Station 1 | Station 2 | Station 3 | Station 4 |
| :-----------: |:---------:| :--------:| :--------:| :-------: |
| Vaisala (CO2) | &#9745;   | &#9745;   | &#9745;   | &#9745;   |
| HOBO EC       | &#9745;   |   &#9745; |           | &#9745;   |
| HOBO DO       | &#9745;   | &#9745;   |           | &#9745;   |
| Level Logger  | &#9745;   |           | &#9745;   |           |

Add 2 transects for eosFD

### Experiment #2
#### Finding the gas transfer velocity

Faq = k[pCO2aq - pCO2air] K h

+ Faq comes from eosFD
+ pCO2aq comes from handheld Vaisala
+ pCO2air use either 380 or could use eosFD but wont change much either way
+ K600 = V x S ^.89+-.0020 x D x 503    (V = velocity, D = Depth, S = slope in degrees)

#### Sensors
+ eosFD
+ Handheld Vaisala
+ Golden Rod

#### Other Equipment
+ Tape Measure

#### Procedure
Start in the stream near the ranger station and move upstream. At each point we will:
+ Insert the eosFD into the stream bed
+ **Immediately downstream of the eosFD**
+ Measure stream width
+ Measure velocity with Golden Rod
+ Measure depth in the middle (divide by 2 to get avg depth)
+ Measure slope with range finder
+ Take a reading with the handheld Vaisala
+ Take GPS Reading 
+ Mark whether the point is covered by vegetation or open to the sky
+ **LAST THING: Pull air sample from eosFD collar**

### Experiment #3

Sensors in use:

**Vaisala** CO2 Probes

**eosFD** CO2 flux chambers
