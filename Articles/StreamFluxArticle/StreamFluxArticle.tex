\begin{abstract}
Long thought to be a carbon sink, the Páramo region of the Andes may be
a significant carbon source. We evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of
CO\textsubscript{2} concentration and flux in a high-elevation stream.
We measured 15-min dissolved CO\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{2},
and discharge, across a wetland-stream transition, characteristic of
tropical, alpine environments.

\noindent{\bf Plain language summary}\vskip-\parskip

\noindent{Streams emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but how much? Recent
research suggests that steaper streams emit more carbon dioxide since
they are more turbulent, but the amount of carbon dioxide a stream emits
is also dependent on the carbon content of the local ecosystem. The
paramo, which is a region in the high Andes mountains in Peru, Ecuador
and Columbia, above the treeline (\textasciitilde{} 10,000 ft) and below
the snow line (\textasciitilde{} 16,000 ft), is made up of extensive
peatlands which hold enormous amounts of carbon. In the past, it was
believed that the paramo took in carbon from the atmosphere and stored
it however, recent research suggests that the region has reversed course
and is now emitting more carbon into the atmosphere than it is taking
in. A principal way that carbon is moved from the soils into the
atmosphere is through the water cycle. We set up a sensor network in a
stream in the Ecuadorian paramo to measure changes in carbon dioxide and
dissolved oxygen, while also recording stream discharge. We then took
this data and created a method for determining how much carbon dioxide
is being emitted from the stream to the atmosphere and how that relates
to discharge, steepness of the stream, and precipitation.}

\section{Introduction}

It is well known that CO\textsubscript{2} flux from freshwater streams
impacts the global carbon cycle, however our ability to quantify these
affects at a variety of spatial and temporal scales remains limited. The
Páramo has historically been thought to be a carbon sink however, recent
research suggests that it is now a source of carbon to the atmosphere
\citep{carrillO2019breathing}. We tested two methods of quantifying
CO\textsubscript{2} evasion in headwater streams in the Páramo region of
Ecuador and discuss the results and implications of our findings. We
utilized eosense EosFD flux chamber sensors to measure
CO\textsubscript{2} flux directly from streams using in-stream flotation
devices. Additionally, we used multiple Vaisala CO\textsubscript{2}
concentration sensors, fitted with waterproof PTFE sleeves to monitor
change in in-stream concentration and calculated flux by converting
concentration to mass per area time using the formula:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
f=\frac{\Delta ppm}{A}*.0018*\frac{10^6}{44.01}*Q+(R-P)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Where \(f\) equals flux in \(µmol\:m^{-2}s^{-1}\), \(\Delta ppm\) is the
change in CO\textsubscript{2} ppm between sensors, \(R\) is stream
respiration in ppm, \(P\) is gross primary production in ppm, A is the
stream surface area between sensors in \(m^2\), .0018 is the conversion
coefficient for \(CO_2\) from ppm to \(g\:m^{-3}\) and 44.01 is the
molar mass of \(CO_2\).

\subsection{Background}

The Páramo region is characterized by high elevation, mountainous
wetlands that are connected by turbulent streams. Connectivity can be
seasonal and dependent upon precipitation intensity. Our specific site
lies on the western edge of the Andean continental divide. The site
receives mean monthly precipitation of 121 mm (Standard deviation =
61mm). Precipitation is moderately seasonal with maximum precipitation
typically occurring in July and minimum precipitation in February. The
site experiences some level of precipitation on 83.5\% of days. Mean
daily temperature is 50 C. We instrumented a reach approximately 140
meters in length which serves as a direct outlet to a wetland with an
area of 2.3 Ha as well as multiple additional wetlands further upstream.
Four sensor clusters were installed at various intervals representing
various stream gradients (figure 1). A waterfall measuring
\textasciitilde{}4m exists between station 3 and 4.

\section{Methods}

Four Vaisala GM-220 CO\textsubscript{2} sensors were used to measure
dissolved in-stream CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations. We used
waterproof PTFE sleeves, following the method presented in Johnson., et
al.(2010). The Vaisala sensors, which have a range of 0-10,000 ppm, have
a margin of error of 150 ppm (1.5\%). To minimize error, all four
sensors were initially collocated to establish offset values. Two eosFD
(EoSense) chamber sensors were positioned in the stream using custom
made floating platforms. One sensor was located between Station 1 and 2,
and the other was collocated with station 4. To estimate evasion from
the reach, we quantified CO\textsubscript{2} change between station 1
and 4.
