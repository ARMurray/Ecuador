| 1 | 070519 | Friday | 5 undergrads, Diego, Andrew, Andrea, Estoban, Claudia, Secundo | Very foggy/rainy and cold. Limited visibility. Clearing by the afternoon | Mainly exploring and hiking around. Took some initial vaisala and YSI measurements at what we're calling WPI (Western Peatland 1) and also very high up close to the antenna (marked as VAIS01). Most measurements and GPS points here were preliminary. Dealing with some altitude sickness today. Attempted to use rangefinder but were unable due to low visibility. | |
| 2 | 070619 | Saturday | 5 undergrads, Diego, Andrew, Alyssa | From weather station: 632 hPa; 2.6 C; 99.7% humidity. Very foggy/rainy and cold. Limited visibility. Significant wind. | We put in 700hPa as the pressure setting on the vaisala b/c that was the minimum possible. Started recording vaisala and YSI readings from GPS points in a table in field notebook. This mostly occurred in the WPI site. We also identified our main channel that we are going to be using as our "focus watershed" in reference to Experiment 1 and 3. Began to mark 10m segments from the outlet of the main channel we are going to be working with. GPS as OUTWETC1. Andrew and Meg hiked this channel and took GPS points here. | |
| 3 | 070919 | Tuesday | 5 undergrads, Diego, Estoban, Andrew, Alyssa | Need to check weather station. Partly clear. Very wet and cold. Was raining on and off throughout the day. | Missed Monday because we decided to spend a lab day to make sure we had everything together. We spent most of the day Monday building vaisala stations, wells, Eos platform. In field today, deployed the 4 vaisala stations: Station 1 - 6.2m from base flag at the outlet of the peatland Station 2 - 20m from Station 1 (26.2m from base)Station 3 - 30m from Station 2 (56.2m from base) Station 4 - below waterfall. Need to calculate estimated distance from base via GPS. Clear enough to use the rangefinder. Did so with Diego. Where Diego was standing marked as "DIEGORANGE". Image with distances in field notebook; need to copy to digital via Andrew's computer. Nehemiah began doing discharge. Unsure how many sections were done. Deployed both EOS. First is located between station 1 and 2 and the second co-deployed with station 4. Anayancy- please add how many loggers you deployed. I am unsure. | Realized that we are going to need more batteries. One of the batteries brought from Galapagos is dead for good. |
| 4 | 071019 | Wednesday | 5 undergrads, Alyssa, Diego, Andrew | Very nice weather. Chilly, partly cloudy, no precipitation. Still wet. | Discharge in 4 places. Checked and pulled data from the 4 stations and both EOS. Deployed the C6. Deployed additional level loggers?Handheld vaisala and YSI measurements in WP1. Tried to relocate via GPS puddles 1-5 from the initial measurements on 070619. Need to flag. Have a total of 15 points now. Found additional interesting points directly up a small slope near WP1, a hole at least 2m deep with water flowing inside. | |
| 5 | 071119 | Thursday | 5 undergrads, Alyssa, Diego, Andrew | Thursday morning was dry. Mostly clear skies. One of our nicest days thus far. | Deployed C6 improperly. Could not pull data off of it. Was reading but not recording data. Must ensure you disconnect battery after telling it to deploy and then reconnect it. Discharge in 4 places MADI's B-DAY. Water samples in three locations: 1. Outlet of stream	2. Down by ranger station 3. Across peatland at water outflow Chloe found. A lot of hiking around the far side of the watershed and mapping that. Chloe mapped the border of the peatland. | When checked: V1-12.4 V2-12.3 V3-12.28 V4-12.28 C6-13.3 EOSFD1-13.08 EOSFD2-? |
| 6 | 071219 | Friday | 5 undergrads, Diego, Andrew | Rained Thursday night. Mostly clear but wet and foggy. No major precipitation while in the field. | Salt slug. CO2 injection. Had to do two because we had not reprogrammed the sensors for 1 min sampling time. First injection was at 11:47; second one began at 13:00 and ended at 16:00. Pulled data from all stations, Eos, and C6. Flow meter at unit of 10. Took handheld vaisala measurements right above injection for background | When checked: V1-11.99 V2-11.91 V3-11.80 V4-11.90 C6-12.2 EOSFD1-12.54 EOSFD2-12.49 All batteries replaced by the time we left (recharged via bus). This includes C6, both EOS, and the vaisala boxes. | 
| 7 | 071519 | Monday | 5 undergrads, Diego, Andrew | Serious rain over the weekend. Looking for weather station data to get a number on the amount of rain. Stream depth increased by at least a half meter in two hours over the weekend. During the field day today, mostly rainy with some sleet and snow, fog quickly moving through | We pulled data from all four vaisalas. EOS 2 was decked- was completely submerged had to save it. EOS 1 was fine. C6 was completely underwater but fine; successfully pulled data from it. EOS 2 was taken back to Casa Magnolia because it was not connecting in the field. It later connected and seems ok. Maribel and Meg deployed two soil vaisalas with the C6 battery and CR1000x. Anayancy got level logger 1 and EC 1 and DO  1data; EC 2 and DO 2 data. Nehemiah did a salt slug and would not respond to my question for any other comments on what he did today so who knows. | Need to get battery info from book. | 
| 8 | 071619 | Tuesday | 5 undergrads, Diego, Andrew, Gonzalo | Significant reduction in stream water level today. Almost back to baseline levels. Cloudy but fog descending as the day went on. About average amount of cold. | Injection day. Got to the field around 12:30. Stayed until 8:30. Injected from 14:15 - 20:00 at a rate of 10 (1067mL/m). Switched all the vaisalas and EOS 1 to 1 minute and 5 minutes respectively. Vaisala 4 stopped recording around 14:00. Unsure why still. Probably battery disconnected because datalogger was reading. Chloe and Meg did gas pulls with EOS 2. Did the transect closests to the stream (COL1-4) and then made a new transect on the far side of the peatland starting at the upwelling (COL5-8). Only made it through COL 7 because it was getting dark. Also talk an ambient air bag so there are 8 bags to analyze in the Picarro. Nehemiah did discharge at all 4 stations and pH at station 2 every 5 mins. Salt slug at the injection point for stations 1 and 2 at 16:58. Anayancy took water samples from the three places (bottom of stream, injection point, and upwelling). Also pulled data from levellogger, DO, EC, C6, vaisala, EOS. Maribel took background CO2 during injection every 15 minutes. Pulled out the two soil vaisalas that were put in yesterday with the C6 battery and CR1000x because they maxed out and it took alot of power from the C6. | When checked: C6, 1000x, 2 vaisalas: 2.64V V1-12.73V EOS1-12.78V V2-12.38V V3-12.94V V4-11.7V | 
| 9 | 071719 | Wednesday | Andrew, Chloe, Maribel | Not alot of sun, very rainy and foggy. Not extremely cold. | Got to the field around 1:15. Checked batteries, downloaded data from the 4 vaisala stations, installed three levelloggers: 1 in the focus watershed and 2 above the high waterfall. | All batteries checked all ok except changed C6 and Vaisala station 2. | 
| 10 | 071819 | Thursday | Andrew, 5 undergrads | Cold with dense fog/mist most of the morning. Some clearing in the mid afternoon | Got into the field around 10:30. Goal today = synoptics. Maribel on Vaisala. Anayancy and Nehemiah marking flags and discharge. Meg and Chloe on Eos pulls. Did EOS pulls at the following flags: SYN1, SYN5, SYN8, SYN11, SYN14, below waterfall (BW), SYN20, SYN23, SYN29, SYN34. | All batteries looked good. Necessary ones changed. |
| 11 | 071919 | Friday | Andrew, 5 undergrads | Nehemiah, Andrew, Maribel did spot checks up at the top of the peatland. They also added new points on the eastern part by the high waterfall. No GPS in tow so need to go back and mark those points. Pulled EOS1, C6, 4 vaisalas, levellogger and barrologger data. Anayancy took water samples. Put EOS 2 and platform by the wetland mountain. Andrew had trouble pulling levellogger data but Anayancy's computer was able to do it.  |C6-13.3V- changed. Changed EOS1 and Vais 2 and 1. Vais 1 was at 12.71. Changed vais 3 and 4. |
| 12 | 072219 | Monday | Andrew, 5 undergrads, Claudia, Secondo, Estoban | Cold and rainy, not as cold early and getting increasingly so towards nightfall | Got there around 2. Unable to pull C6 data. Did nighttime injection. Chloe and Meg did EOS transects. Nehemiah got very cold towards the end and we went ahead and shut down the injection around 7:45pm. Speed of injection at 20 units| C6 - not connecting. Didn't deploy over the weekend?. EOS1 - 12.49, V1 - 8.89 V, V2- 12.15V, V3-11.05 V, V4-11.89V, EOS2-12.4V. | 
| 13 | 072319 | Tuesday | Andrew, Maribel, Chloe, Meg |Rainy and cold | C6 still not responding. Decide to pull it today and take it back to the lab. Pulled all vaisala and EOS 1 and EC and DO. Still trouble with levelloggers. Testing vaisala background against V1. Still not reporting correctly. Level logger stat3 serial # 0421. Well by road #0432. By hill #0442. | necessary battery changed | 
| 14 | 072419 | Wednesday | Andrew and 5 undergrads | rainy and pretty windy. Slight clearning by the afternoon. | Got to the field around 11:40. Chloe and Andrew doing batteries and data. Nehemiah doing discharge. Spot checks with Maribel, Meg and Anayancy. Very windy up there and tough. | necessary batteries changed |
| 15 | 072519 | Thursday | Andrew, 5 undergrads, Kriddie (!!) | less cold today but rainy. | Synoptics today. Extremely high flow today. Had to change up some EOS pull locations because of the flow. Chloe and Andrew on EOS upper locations. Meg and Kriddie EOS lower and falcon tubes. Maribel on handheld vaisala. EOSSYN1 about 2 meters downstream because flow too fast and too much for the platform. | Necessary batteries changed. | 
| 16 | 072619 | Friday | Andrew, 5 undergrads, Kriddie | not as cold but rainy. Similar to yesterday. | Got there around 11:15 am. Going to switch vaisala station 2 to a CR300 because the omega datalogger appears to be waterlogged. Programmed it to just read the Mv and that appears to be working. Changed all stations to 1 minute and switched all batteries and EOS. Daytime injeection today for 2 hours. Started at 12:45 at speed of 30 units. | All batteries changed. | 
| 17 | 072919 | Monday | Andrew, 5 undergrads, Kriddie | most clear and beautiful weather yet. Could see Antisana and Cotopaxi. Cloud cover increasing by the afternoon | Got there at 10:30. Goal for today was synoptics. Didn't happen because Golden Rod battery lost in stream. So change of plans. Maribel continues to take vaisala points at all of the synoptics flags. Checked all voltages and pulled data. EOS transects. Chloe and Andrew did collarrs 1-4 and Kriddie and Meg did collars 5-8. Tried an experiemental and regular back at collar 5, the experimental being first mixing with some outside air and then pulling it clean. Deployed EOS2 at the mountain wetland. EOS 1 put back in its location between statations 1 and 2. Byron went to go look for a battery with no luck. | 4 vaisala station batteries changed. | 
| 18 | 073019 | Tuesday | Andrew, Kriddie, Chloe, Meg, Maribel, Estoban, Andrea. | Started out very clear and windy at the top of the Antennas. Rainy and clouds by mid-afternoon. | Today Nehemiah and Anayancy in lab. Nehemiah found a new golden rod battery. Arrived at antennas around 10:50. Started hike from the top of the Antennas and eventually made it down all the way to our focus watershed. Saw deer and an Andean condor. Started off going to ANT 1 watershed where Estoban had wells. This was to the left of the road if going up towards the very top of antenna road. Then went down the other side and slowly made out way down. Took 13 spot checks along the way, some in already established wells. Also saw an Andean Teal and Tarmagen bird. Also showed the Togaro (mucus plant). Made it back by around 14:30-15:00. Also put out the 2 planks that Estoban and Andrea brought | Changed both EOS batteries | 
| 19 | 073119 | Wednesday | Andrew, Kriddie, 5 undergrads. | Very rainy. Hailing a bit. Ice on the ground from what appears to be frozen precip and snow the night before. Clouds and fog rolling through. Slight clearing and sunshine by late afternoon (around 14:30 sun, rain stop around 12:00). | Got to field by 10:45. Synoptics today. Anayancy and Nehemiah on discharge. Maribel on vaisala. Andrew and Chloe on EOS1 synoptics on upper half of stream. Kriddie and Meg on EOS2 synoptics on lower half of stream. Anayancy did water samples. EOS 2 was in mountain wetland before we did synoptics and EOS1 was in normal place between stations 1 and 2. EOS 2 was moved to location between station 2 and 3 when left today. Confusion with timing of data on EOS 1 . . . time appears to be 24 hours off. | both EOS batteries changed. Vaisala station batteries all ok. | 
| 20 | 080119 | Thursday | Andrew, Kriddie, Nehemiah, Meg, Maribel | Not as cold. Slightly rainy/drizzly | Arrived around 14:20. Goals = nighttime injection and EOS transects. Injected from 16:00-20:00. Rate 20. Not 30 b/c too much bubble escape this way. Maribel-handheld vaisala until we finally got CR300 and Vais 2 to work (!! YAY) Meg-EOS transects. Nehemiah- discharge, pH. EOS2 redeployed after transects at 15 minute intervals at 18:50 between station 2 and 3. Unable to pull anything but Station 1 because very cold and toughbook was angry. | All vaisala batteries changed. EOS1 ok, EOS2 changed |
