| Figure showing comparison in flux over time from collars separated by condition. Top figure shows flux of the four collars in unsaturated soil, second shows the three collars that were in saturated soil conditions, last shows the flux of the collar in the bubbling spring.

| Figure showing comparison in flux between collar flux and flux along positions of the stream. The goal of this figure is to compare magnitude of flux in different soil conditions to stream conditions. It is seen that collar flux and flux of stream is comparable after the waterfall, but is much larger in stream before waterfall.

| Figure showing comparison in flux between the eos in the floating platform behind station 1 (blue) and the other eos in the saturated soil adjacent to the eos in the water. It is over a small time but it shows diel variability in the water but not in the soil.

| Figure showing comparison in flux between the eos in the floating platform behind station 1 (blue) and the other eos in the unsaturated soil adjacent to the eos in the water further up on the hill. It is over a small time but it shows opposite diel variability in the water versus the soil.

| Figure showing comparison in flux between the eos in the floating platform behind station 1 (blue) and the other eos in the far wetland where there was no movement in standing water. It is over a small time but it shows similar diel variability in the water, yet shows scale of moving vs stagnent water.
