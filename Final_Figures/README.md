## How to edit the above table

The table above is in 'Markdown' which basically turns regular text into more stylistic text. A very useful document on how to write specific things in markdown can be found [HERE](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). First, edit this document by clicking the pencil in the top-right corner. This will bring you to the raw-text version of this markdown file. The columns are denoted by the words inbetween '|' symbols. You will notice in my example row, the text was too long for one line. You can ignore this because it will automatically 'wrap' to the next line and still show up as one line in the table.

### Column Definitions

**Owner:** Your name so we know who made what

**Figure Path:** the path to the figure inside of this folder

**Path (figure creation):** This should be the path to the file where you created the figure. This should be either a .R or .RMD file. It could even be a .xml (excel) file as long as it is somewhere on github.

**Path (data):** This should be the path to the data used to create the figure. If you use more then one dataset that's fine, just add a comma in between them

**Description:** A brief description of what the figure shows

**Thumb:** this should be a link to the figure in your folder. The way to add an image is to type ![](urltofigure).

Use the first row I created as a reference and if you have any issues just send me a message and I'll help!
