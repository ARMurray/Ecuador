|Owner|Figure Path|Description|Thumb|
|:---|:---|:---|:----------|
| Andrew | Andrew/DailyEvasionMetabolism34.png| Figure showing evasion, respiration and photosynthesis between stations 3 and 4| ![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/Andrew/DailyEvasionMetabolism34.png)|
| Megan |Meg/c6plotfinal.pdf OR Meg/cgplotfinal_notitles.pdf| Figure showing 5 minute precipitation, discharge, dissolved CO2, flux, CDOM, turbidity, and chlorophyll A during the July14-15 storm event|![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/Meg/c6plotfinal.png) |
| Megan |  Meg/synoptics_persite_final.pdf| Figure showing the corrected values with std. deviation for the 4 synoptic days at each of the 10 sites displayed as 10 plots (one plot for each site). | ![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/Meg/synoptics_persite_final.png)|
| Megan | Meg/synoptics_perday_final.pdf| Figure showing the corrected values with std. deviation for the 4 synoptic days at ecah of the 10 sites displayed as 4 plots (one plot for each day). |![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/Meg/synoptics_perday_final.png)|
| Megan | Meg/collar_percollar_final.pdf|Corrected and average and std. deviation of delta iCO2 for each day at each collar with color-coding by degree of dry/wetness | ![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/Meg/collar_percollar_final.png)
| Chloe| chloe/collars.png| Figure showing comparison in flux over time from collars separated by condition. Top figure shows flux of the four collars in unsaturated soil, second shows the three collars that were in saturated soil conditions, last shows the flux of the collar in the bubbling spring.|![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/chloe/collars.png)|
| Chloe| chloe/collar.png| Figure showing comparison in flux between each collar over all of the days of transect collection. |![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/chloe/collar.png)|
| Chloe| chloe/compare.png| Figure showing comparison in flux between collar flux and flux along positions of the stream. The goal of this figure is to compare magnitude of flux in different soil conditions to stream conditions. It is seen that collar flux and flux of stream is comparable after the waterfall, but is much larger in stream before waterfall. |![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/chloe/compare.png)|
| Chloe| chloe/landvwater.png| Figure showing comparison in flux between the eos in the floating platform behind station 1 (blue) and the other eos in the saturated soil adjacent to the eos in the water. It is over a small time but it shows diel variability in the water but not in the soil. |![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/chloe/landvwater.png)| 
| Chloe| chloe/watervcol.png| Figure showing comparison in flux between the eos in the floating platform behind station 1 (blue) and the other eos in the unsaturated soil adjacent to the eos in the water further up on the hill. It is over a small time but it shows opposite diel variability in the water versus the soil.|![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/chloe/watervcol.png)|
| Chloe| chloe/watervwetland.png| Figure showing comparison in flux between the eos in the floating platform behind station 1 (blue) and the other eos in the far wetland where there was no movement in standing water. It is over a small time but it shows similar diel variability in the water, yet shows scale of moving vs stagnent water. |![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/chloe/watervwetland.png)|
|Maribel|pending|Figure showing pCO2 from five synoptic days and an extra synoptic day done on July 12th. An estimated discharge is added for each day.|![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/Maribel/finalfigure_synoptic%20copy.png)|
|Maribel|pending|Figure showing the average and standard deviation pCO2 of all six synoptic days.|![](https://github.com/ARMurray/Ecuador/blob/testing/Final_Figures/Maribel/FINAL_FIGURE.png)|

|Nehemiah|Nehemiah/Histogram of K600 Total 11_28 Update.png|Final|Figure showing the density of Kinematic K600 magnitudes.

## How to edit the above table

The table above is in 'Markdown' which basically turns regular text into more stylistic text. A very useful document on how to write specific things in markdown can be found [HERE](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). First, edit this document by clicking the pencil in the top-right corner. This will bring you to the raw-text version of this markdown file. The columns are denoted by the words inbetween '|' symbols. You will notice in my example row, the text was too long for one line. You can ignore this because it will automatically 'wrap' to the next line and still show up as one line in the table.

### Column Definitions

**Owner:** Your name so we know who made what

**Figure Path:** the path to the figure inside of this folder

**Description:** A brief description of what the figure shows

**Thumb:** this should be a link to the figure in your folder. The way to add an image is to type ![](urltofigure).

## Edit README in each of your folders
Add a new file called 'README.md' inside of your folder and create a table with the following variables to describe how and where your figures were created



Use the first row I created as a reference and if you have any issues just send me a message and I'll help!

**Figure Path:** the path to the figure inside of this folder

**Path (figure creation):** This should be the path to the file where you created the figure. This should be either a .R or .RMD file. It could even be a .xml (excel) file as long as it is somewhere on github.

**Path (data):** This should be the path to the data used to create the figure. If you use more then one dataset that's fine, just add a comma in between them
